        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p> Photography has been a hobby of mine since i was 12. I bought my first film SLR camera from the local newspaper ads. Although i studied the art of photgraphy for 2 years it wasnt something i wanted to persue as a career, but more as a
          hobby.</p>

        <h3>Automotive</h3>
        <p>Fixing cars is something that came naturally to me mainly through taking apart anything mechanical from a young age to understand how it worked. Although i like fixing cars, the only car i want to work on is my own. i worked in the
          automotive industry for 3 years and decided that it isnt something i want to do for the rest of my life. I prefer tinkering with cars and bikes at the weekend.</p>
